# BE172_cardiac_inflation
 Passive inflation of a frog ventricle using FEA

Use the nbgitpuller link generator to make opening the jupyter noteboook easy for the students.  This downloads the repo onto the student's datahub account and opens the inflation notebook https://jupyterhub.github.io/nbgitpuller/link.html 

Notes from 2020:
"The TA that helped the students the most with the FEM said it worked well. He did say that several students weren't sure about getting the PV data from each run with a different C. Did your script make a plot (or export data) of more than one model PV curve? My thought was that they would run the model with a C, get the data and make their own plot(s). I guess if they were lazy, they wanted the script to make the plot with all of the model PV curves. So maybe a tiny bit of explanation for that would help, but other than that, he said it worked well." - Email from Jeff Omens
