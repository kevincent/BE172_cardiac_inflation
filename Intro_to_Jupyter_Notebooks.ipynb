The Jupyter notebook uses distributed computing, this means that when you execute code, it will run distributed in the cloud (UCSD's datahub cluster, to be specific). You can also use and run Jupyter locally on your machine, in which case it starts a kernel behind the scenes, and uses your default browser to interact with this kernel."
