The Jupyter notebook uses distributed computing, this means that when you execute code, it will run distributed in the cloud (UCSD's datahub cluster, to be specific). You can also use and run Jupyter locally on your machine, in which case it starts a kernel behind the scenes, and uses your default browser to interact with this kernel."

The first time you log in for this class, you will probably use the nbgitpuller link.  That link downloads the code repository and opens the Jupyter notebook for you - avoiding the need to go through the dashboard.  However, if you log directly into the UCSD datahub, you will see the dashboard and can use it to navigate to the notebook you want to open.  If you followed the nbgitpuller link to open the notebook, you can access the dashboard by selecting `File -> Open...`\n",
